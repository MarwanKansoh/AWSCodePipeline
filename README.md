# CloudFormationTemplates
An exceptionally basic pipeline with AWS CodeCommit for the code repository and AWS CodePipeline as a pipeline triggering AWS Cloudformation stacks. 

This Cloudformation template is usable in any account provided you have rights to create the below:
- IAM roles
- CodeCommit rights
- CodePipeline rights
- S3 rights
- Cloudformation rights

Further details on the right required for each service will be added later on. This is only for sandpit purposes.
